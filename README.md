# Red Badger coding challenge resolution by Antonio Cordasco (Martian Robots)

## Installation

simply run: npm install

## Execution

run: node index.js

This will run the code with the sample input in the "input.txt" file.
To try other inputs you can edit that file, or add a new file and supply it as a parameter when running the application.
For example, if you create a new file called "newInput.txt" in the root, you can use it by runnig: node index.js newInput.js
